				<p>Show a slow transition of leaves from bright yellow to dark gray. Using a random seed, to generate differnt stages of decay state and leaf dimensions.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The orignal leaf shape was imitated from https://editor.p5js.org/b0175459j/sketches/ctkbv_zrR. I also added a bunch of snow piles in the background to add more details that are accurate to the image. I added some dark gray spots on the leaves that are random showing the leavings at a mid decay stage. </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, it was simple enough to create the leaf cycle and with the help of ChatGPT, I was able to create a slow transition from yellow leaves to dark gray. The Glitch program had some limits to what I had envisioned for the project so I transferred to VScode where the portfolio goes in. It was pretty difficult trying to create the dark patchy spots as some functions in p5js don't give me what I exactly wanted. I had to stick with a bunch of dark gray circles that combine together inside the leaf. It would be nice to have the patchy spots slowly take over the leaf but was deemed too difficult and time consuming. Overall, I am pretty proud with the way the project turned out, but maybe I should've chosen an inspiring image that would make it more flexible. </p>
