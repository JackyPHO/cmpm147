				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Creating a dungeons and overworld level generator using autotiling logic</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I am messing around with the generateGrid functions to set some characters to place certain tiles on a particular character. I mainly took inspiration from the Rouge example. Made a dungeons and overworld button so that the user can switch between each scene. I brought life to the project by adding random chests inside each room in the dungeon then clicking on the chest to make them disappear. Made a dungeons and overworld button so that the user can switch between each scene. </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I enjoyed messing around with the tileset and trying to set them to my scene. Although, the process took a very long time trying to check for certain conditions and ensuring that the drawContext will work with the matching tiles. Sometimes, the tiles wonâ€™t render properly because of some random error that may have occurred during the character placement process. Nevertheless, this project was fun because it was cool to be able to see my level design come to life. </p>
